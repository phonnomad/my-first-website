  JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</a></h2>

<P>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
   alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
   and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
    dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
